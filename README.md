# figs2FGS-CSPackage
This repository will now for a start contain two files, one .xquery and one xslt, for the purpose of harvesting METS-files from the su.figshare.com instance by means of OAI-PMH, and transforming them to sip metadatafiles compliant with the Riksarkivet (RA) - National Archives of Sweden model FGS (FÃ¶rvaltningsgemensam specifikation) - CSPackage (Common Specification). Since the METS file metadata obtained from figshare via OAI-PMH is insufficient for this purpose, it has to be complemented by metadata using the figshare base API. This is why the .xquery file is needed.

The xq-file is for extracting figshare filedata by means of the base API "https://api.figshare.com/v2/articles/" as a complement to the OAI-PMH-feeds in METS (base API - https://api.figshare.com/v2/oai?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=mets), where these filedata are not as complete, lacking e.g. md5 CHECKSUMS and original filenames with extensions, from which MIMETYPE can be constructed in the transformation to FGS-CSPackage. [In an earlier version of this xq-file these filedata were instead extracted from the JSON-arrays inherent in the corresponding html-pages of the DOI:s found in the dc:identifier-elements of the OAI-PMH-feeds, but these were later also found to be incomplete, in particular for items with more than 10 associated datafiles.] The first declared variable in the .xq-file, $mdFilePath is your input file, the OAI-PMH-feed downloaded as an xml-file.The resulting "file_info feed" from running the xquery is not a wellformed xml-file yet, a root-element must be added in a local xml-editor, but it contains all necessary file metadata from the api plus some extradata drawn from ORCID and the local user database at Stockholm University - SUKAT, converted to xml. [The search URL:s for the SUKAT-data will be removed here in the public version, but with the variable names preserved, to be replaced if needed by other local metadata sources These will then be used as a parameter document in the transformation of the original feed data to FGS-CSPackage.] The new .xquery-file has an inherent version history, describing internal development before this newest version is published.   

The xslt-file still has 3 parameters to be specified in the setup: 

deliveryFeedType = 'oai'
deliveryMethodId = '3'
file_info_data = 'doc('${cfdu}/file_info.xml')' 

where the last is most essential and should be set up as an XPath expression (tick the box).
For the time being it should be run only for individual items, thus extracted from the resulting feeds, but this might change for coming versions, so that you could run it for a whole feed at a time.
Also, the file-extension to mime-type map has been extended and updated to cover many more file-extensions, such as e.g. .csv, .py, .Rmd  etc. For later additions of file extensions to the mapping table sources and dates are shown for (meta)data provenance.
The xslt-file also has an inherent version history.

It should be remarked that that the xslt-file still contains some preliminary hard coding (especially in the METS-header), awaiting recommended values from the development of a dedicated FGS - Common Specification model for research information and / or research datasets. This might necessitate adding further extension elements and / or attributes to the METS-file.

To work together, the specific 'file_info.xml' parameter doc (created by the .xquery) and the item xml-file (extracted from the OAI-PMH-feed) on which to run the xslt, should both be in the same folder.
